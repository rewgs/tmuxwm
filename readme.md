# tmuxwm

Fork of https://github.com/kasperlewau/tmuxwm, which itself was "shamelessly stolen off of beardjay (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beardyjay/dotfiles) and TrilbyWhite (https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/junkdrawer/blob/master/tmuxwm.c), with some modifications to fit my needs."

I plan on seeing if this could end up being the ideal extremely light-weight VM "DE." Haven't done anything with this yet, though, so at the moment is exactly the same as kasperlewau's.
